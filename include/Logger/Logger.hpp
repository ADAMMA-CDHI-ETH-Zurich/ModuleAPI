	 *
	 * While compiling, it's checked if the library is built for Android
	 * or any other architecture. The logger class provides platform indepent
	 * logging by using preprocessor directives to only compile those
	 * functions that are needed on the given architecture.
	 * On Linux for example, the logger prints to stdout.
	 * On Android however, the logging library is used and the logger
	 * prints to the logcat output console.
